## Overview
PickerTest is sample to demonstrate few things. In one of the interview, I was asked with 2 questions:
1. How would you pick objects in 3D world with mouse pointer.
2. There are millions of points in point cloud on screen. Select points within area created with mouse drag. Add functionality to change those points into shapes: Triangles, Rect, Hexagon, circle.

Since answer was given theoretically and may be, it wasn't well delivered. So, i thought of implementing it to get some handson.

## Note
Development is in progress. More detailed ReadMe in future.
